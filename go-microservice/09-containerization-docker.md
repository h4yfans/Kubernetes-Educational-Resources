# Containerization with Docker for Microservices

This guide covers containerization strategies for microservices using Docker, with a focus on best practices and Go implementations.

## Introduction

Containerization is a critical aspect of modern microservice architectures. Docker containers provide a consistent, isolated environment for your services, making them portable across different environments and simplifying deployment.

This document explores Docker containerization for Go microservices, covering everything from basic concepts to advanced multi-stage builds and optimization techniques.

## Docker Basics for Microservices

### Key Containerization Concepts

Before diving into implementation, it's important to understand some key concepts:

1. **Container**: A lightweight, standalone, executable package that includes everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, libraries, and settings.

2. **Image**: A read-only template used to create containers. Images are built in layers, with each layer representing a set of filesystem changes.

3. **Dockerfile**: A text file containing instructions for building a Docker image.

4. **Registry**: A repository for storing and distributing Docker images (e.g., Docker Hub, AWS ECR, Google Container Registry).

5. **Docker Compose**: A tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications.

6. **Container Orchestration**: Systems like Kubernetes that automate the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

### Benefits of Containerization for Microservices

Containerization offers several advantages for microservice architectures:

1. **Consistency**: Ensures your service runs the same way in every environment, from development to production.

2. **Isolation**: Each service runs in its own container with its dependencies, preventing conflicts.

3. **Resource Efficiency**: Containers share the host OS kernel, making them more lightweight than virtual machines.

4. **Scalability**: Containers can be quickly started and stopped, facilitating horizontal scaling.

5. **DevOps Integration**: Containers fit naturally into CI/CD pipelines and infrastructure-as-code practices.

6. **Technology Diversity**: Different services can use different languages, frameworks, and dependencies without conflicts.

### Docker Installation and Setup

To get started with Docker, you'll need to install Docker Desktop (for Windows/Mac) or Docker Engine (for Linux):

```bash
# For Ubuntu
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io

# Verify installation
docker --version
docker run hello-world
```

For development, you might also want to install Docker Compose:

```bash
sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/v2.18.1/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose

# Verify installation
docker-compose --version
```

## Dockerizing Go Microservices

### Basic Dockerfile for Go

Let's start with a simple Dockerfile for a Go microservice:

```dockerfile
# Use the official Go image as the base image
FROM golang:1.21

# Set the working directory inside the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy go.mod and go.sum files to the working directory
COPY go.mod go.sum ./

# Download dependencies
RUN go mod download

# Copy the source code into the container
COPY . .

# Build the Go application
RUN go build -o service ./cmd/server

# Expose the port the service runs on
EXPOSE 8080

# Command to run the executable
CMD ["./service"]
```

This basic Dockerfile:
1. Uses the official Go image
2. Sets up a working directory
3. Copies and downloads dependencies
4. Copies the source code
5. Builds the application
6. Exposes the service port
7. Specifies the command to run the service

### Multi-Stage Builds for Smaller Images

The basic Dockerfile works, but it produces a large image that includes the Go compiler and build tools. A better approach is to use multi-stage builds:

```dockerfile
# Build stage
FROM golang:1.21 AS builder

WORKDIR /app

# Copy go.mod and go.sum files
COPY go.mod go.sum ./

# Download dependencies
RUN go mod download

# Copy the source code
COPY . .

# Build the application with optimizations
RUN CGO_ENABLED=0 GOOS=linux go build -a -installsuffix cgo -ldflags="-w -s" -o service ./cmd/server

# Final stage
FROM alpine:3.18

# Install CA certificates for HTTPS
RUN apk --no-cache add ca-certificates

WORKDIR /root/

# Copy the binary from the builder stage
COPY --from=builder /app/service .
COPY --from=builder /app/config.yaml .

# Expose the service port
EXPOSE 8080

# Command to run the service
CMD ["./service"]
```

This multi-stage Dockerfile:
1. Uses a Go image to build the application
2. Compiles the Go code with optimizations
3. Creates a final image based on Alpine Linux (much smaller)
4. Copies only the compiled binary and necessary files
5. Results in a significantly smaller image (typically 15-20MB vs 1GB+)

### Optimizing Go Binaries for Docker

To further optimize your Go binaries for Docker:

1. **Disable CGO**: `CGO_ENABLED=0` creates a statically linked binary that doesn't depend on C libraries.

2. **Cross-compile for Linux**: `GOOS=linux` ensures the binary is built for Linux, regardless of your development OS.

3. **Strip debugging information**: `-ldflags="-w -s"` removes debugging information and symbol tables, reducing binary size.

4. **Use Alpine or Distroless**: Alpine Linux provides a minimal base image. Google's distroless images are even smaller.

5. **Enable compiler optimizations**: `-a -installsuffix cgo` rebuilds all packages with optimizations.

### Using Distroless Images

For even smaller and more secure images, consider using Google's distroless images:

```dockerfile
# Build stage
FROM golang:1.21 AS builder

WORKDIR /app

COPY go.mod go.sum ./
RUN go mod download

COPY . .
RUN CGO_ENABLED=0 GOOS=linux go build -a -installsuffix cgo -ldflags="-w -s" -o service ./cmd/server

# Final stage
FROM gcr.io/distroless/static-debian11

WORKDIR /

COPY --from=builder /app/service /service
COPY --from=builder /app/config.yaml /config.yaml

EXPOSE 8080

# The distroless image doesn't have a shell, so use the binary directly
CMD ["/service"]
```

Distroless images:
- Contain only your application and its runtime dependencies
- Don't include package managers, shells, or other programs
- Reduce attack surface and image size
- Are ideal for production environments

## Docker Compose for Local Development

Docker Compose is an essential tool for developing and testing microservices locally. It allows you to define and run multi-container applications with a single command.

### Basic Docker Compose File

Here's a basic `docker-compose.yml` file for a microservice architecture with a user service, an order service, and a shared database:

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  users-service:
    build:
      context: ./users-service
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    ports:
      - "8081:8080"
    environment:
      - DB_HOST=postgres
      - DB_PORT=5432
      - DB_USER=postgres
      - DB_PASSWORD=postgres
      - DB_NAME=users
    depends_on:
      - postgres
    restart: unless-stopped

  orders-service:
    build:
      context: ./orders-service
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    ports:
      - "8082:8080"
    environment:
      - DB_HOST=postgres
      - DB_PORT=5432
      - DB_USER=postgres
      - DB_PASSWORD=postgres
      - DB_NAME=orders
      - USERS_SERVICE_URL=http://users-service:8080
    depends_on:
      - postgres
      - users-service
    restart: unless-stopped

  postgres:
    image: postgres:15
    ports:
      - "5432:5432"
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_USER=postgres
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres
      - POSTGRES_MULTIPLE_DATABASES=users,orders
    volumes:
      - postgres-data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
      - ./scripts/create-multiple-dbs.sh:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/create-multiple-dbs.sh
    restart: unless-stopped

volumes:
  postgres-data:
```

This Docker Compose file:
1. Defines three services: users-service, orders-service, and postgres
2. Builds the microservices from their respective Dockerfiles
3. Maps container ports to host ports
4. Sets environment variables for configuration
5. Establishes dependencies between services
6. Configures persistent storage for the database

### Development-Specific Configurations

For development, you might want to add features like hot reloading and debugging. Here's an enhanced version:

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  users-service:
    build:
      context: ./users-service
      dockerfile: Dockerfile.dev  # Development-specific Dockerfile
    ports:
      - "8081:8080"
      - "2345:2345"  # Delve debugger port
    environment:
      - DB_HOST=postgres
      - DB_PORT=5432
      - DB_USER=postgres
      - DB_PASSWORD=postgres
      - DB_NAME=users
      - LOG_LEVEL=debug
    volumes:
      - ./users-service:/app  # Mount source code for hot reloading
    command: ["air", "-c", ".air.toml"]  # Use Air for hot reloading
    depends_on:
      - postgres
    restart: unless-stopped

  # Other services...
```

### Development Dockerfile Example

Here's a `Dockerfile.dev` that supports hot reloading and debugging:

```dockerfile
FROM golang:1.21

# Install Air for hot reloading
RUN go install github.com/cosmtrek/air@latest

# Install Delve for debugging
RUN go install github.com/go-delve/delve/cmd/dlv@latest

WORKDIR /app

# Copy go.mod and go.sum
COPY go.mod go.sum ./

# Download dependencies
RUN go mod download

# Source code will be mounted at runtime
# Command will be provided by docker-compose

EXPOSE 8080
EXPOSE 2345  # Delve debugger port
```

### Running Docker Compose

To start your microservices locally:

```bash
# Start all services
docker-compose up

# Start in detached mode
docker-compose up -d

# Start specific services
docker-compose up users-service postgres

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f

# Stop all services
docker-compose down

# Stop and remove volumes
docker-compose down -v
```

### Handling Database Migrations

For database migrations, you can create a separate service or use an init script:

```yaml
services:
  # ... other services

  migrations:
    build:
      context: ./migrations
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    environment:
      - DB_HOST=postgres
      - DB_PORT=5432
      - DB_USER=postgres
      - DB_PASSWORD=postgres
    depends_on:
      - postgres
    command: ["./wait-for-it.sh", "postgres:5432", "--", "./run-migrations.sh"]
```

The `wait-for-it.sh` script ensures the database is ready before running migrations:

```bash
#!/bin/sh
# wait-for-it.sh

set -e

host="$1"
shift
cmd="$@"

until nc -z "$host" "${host#*:}"; do
  >&2 echo "Waiting for $host..."
  sleep 1
done

>&2 echo "$host is up - executing command"
exec $cmd
```

## Docker Best Practices for Microservices

### Security Best Practices

Security is critical when containerizing microservices. Here are key practices to follow:

1. **Use Minimal Base Images**:
   - Prefer Alpine or distroless images over full OS images
   - Fewer packages mean fewer potential vulnerabilities

2. **Run as Non-Root User**:
   ```dockerfile
   # Create a non-root user
   RUN adduser -D -u 10001 appuser

   # Switch to the non-root user
   USER appuser
   ```

3. **Scan Images for Vulnerabilities**:
   - Use tools like Trivy, Clair, or Snyk to scan images
   - Integrate scanning into your CI/CD pipeline
   ```bash
   # Example using Trivy
   trivy image your-service:latest
   ```

4. **Use Multi-Stage Builds**:
   - Reduces attack surface by excluding build tools
   - Minimizes image size

5. **Never Hardcode Secrets**:
   - Use environment variables or secret management tools
   - Consider solutions like HashiCorp Vault or Kubernetes Secrets

6. **Set Resource Limits**:
   - Prevent container resource exhaustion
   ```yaml
   # In docker-compose.yml
   services:
     users-service:
       # ...
       deploy:
         resources:
           limits:
             cpus: '0.5'
             memory: 512M
           reservations:
             cpus: '0.1'
             memory: 128M
   ```

7. **Enable Content Trust**:
   - Verify image authenticity
   ```bash
   export DOCKER_CONTENT_TRUST=1
   docker pull your-registry/your-image:tag
   ```

8. **Use Read-Only Filesystems**:
   ```dockerfile
   # Make the filesystem read-only
   VOLUME ["/tmp", "/var/run"]
   CMD ["--read-only"]
   ```

### Performance Optimization

Optimize your Docker images and containers for better performance:

1. **Minimize Layer Count**:
   - Combine related commands in a single RUN instruction
   - Each layer adds overhead

   ```dockerfile
   # Bad practice (multiple layers)
   RUN apt-get update
   RUN apt-get install -y package1
   RUN apt-get install -y package2

   # Good practice (single layer)
   RUN apt-get update && \
       apt-get install -y package1 package2 && \
       rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
   ```

2. **Order Layers by Stability**:
   - Place layers that change less frequently earlier in the Dockerfile
   - Improves build caching

3. **Use .dockerignore**:
   - Exclude unnecessary files from the build context
   - Speeds up builds and reduces image size

   ```
   # .dockerignore
   .git
   .github
   .vscode
   node_modules
   **/*.test.go
   **/*.md
   ```

4. **Optimize for Caching**:
   - Copy dependency files first, then install dependencies
   - Copy source code last, as it changes most frequently

5. **Use BuildKit**:
   - Enables parallel building of independent stages
   - Provides better caching

   ```bash
   export DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1
   docker build -t your-service .
   ```

### Logging and Monitoring

Proper logging and monitoring are essential for containerized microservices:

1. **Log to STDOUT/STDERR**:
   - Docker captures these streams automatically
   - Follows the 12-factor app methodology

2. **Structured Logging**:
   - Use JSON format for machine-parseable logs
   - Include metadata like service name, version, and correlation IDs

   ```go
   log.WithFields(log.Fields{
       "service": "users-service",
       "version": "1.2.3",
       "request_id": requestID,
   }).Info("Processing request")
   ```

3. **Health Checks**:
   - Implement `/health` and `/ready` endpoints
   - Configure in Docker Compose or Kubernetes

   ```yaml
   # In docker-compose.yml
   services:
     users-service:
       # ...
       healthcheck:
         test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://localhost:8080/health"]
         interval: 30s
         timeout: 10s
         retries: 3
         start_period: 40s
   ```

4. **Expose Metrics**:
   - Implement Prometheus metrics endpoints
   - Monitor container resource usage

5. **Centralized Logging**:
   - Use solutions like ELK Stack, Fluentd, or Loki
   - Aggregate logs from all services

## Interview Questions and Answers

### 1. What are the key benefits of containerizing microservices with Docker?

**Answer:**
Containerizing microservices with Docker provides several significant benefits:

1. **Consistency Across Environments**: Docker containers ensure that your microservice runs the same way in development, testing, and production environments, eliminating the "it works on my machine" problem.

2. **Isolation**: Each microservice runs in its own container with its dependencies, preventing conflicts between services with different requirements.

3. **Resource Efficiency**: Containers share the host OS kernel, making them more lightweight than virtual machines. This allows you to run more services on the same hardware.

4. **Fast Startup and Scaling**: Containers start in seconds, enabling rapid scaling and deployment of microservices in response to demand.

5. **Improved Developer Experience**: Developers can run the entire system locally without complex setup, and they can focus on their specific service while having realistic dependencies.

6. **Simplified Deployment**: Docker images package everything needed to run the service, simplifying the deployment process and reducing configuration errors.

7. **Technology Diversity**: Different microservices can use different languages, frameworks, and dependencies without conflicts, allowing teams to choose the best tool for each job.

8. **Infrastructure as Code**: Dockerfile and Docker Compose files serve as documentation and executable specifications for your infrastructure.

9. **CI/CD Integration**: Docker containers fit naturally into continuous integration and deployment pipelines, enabling automated testing and deployment.

10. **Portability**: Docker containers can run on any platform that supports Docker, from a developer's laptop to various cloud providers.

### 2. Explain the difference between Docker images and containers in the context of microservices.

**Answer:**
In the context of microservices, understanding the difference between Docker images and containers is crucial:

**Docker Images:**
- An image is a read-only template or blueprint for creating containers
- Images are built from a Dockerfile, which contains instructions for setting up the environment
- Images are immutable; once built, they don't change
- Images are composed of layers, with each layer representing a set of filesystem changes
- Images can be stored in registries (like Docker Hub or private registries) and shared across teams
- For microservices, each service typically has its own image
- Images contain the application code, runtime, libraries, and dependencies needed for a microservice

**Docker Containers:**
- A container is a runnable instance of an image
- Containers are the actual running processes that execute your microservice
- Containers are ephemeral and can be started, stopped, moved, or deleted
- Each container is isolated from other containers and the host system
- Containers add a writable layer on top of the image layers
- For microservices, you typically run multiple containers from different images
- Containers can be scaled horizontally by running multiple instances of the same image

**Key Differences in Microservice Context:**
- You build an image once but run it as multiple container instances for scaling
- Images represent your microservice at build time; containers represent it at runtime
- Multiple versions of a microservice can exist as different image tags
- Container orchestration tools like Kubernetes manage containers, not images
- When updating a microservice, you build a new image but replace the running containers

### 3. How would you optimize a Docker image for a Go microservice?

**Answer:**
Optimizing Docker images for Go microservices involves several techniques:

1. **Use Multi-Stage Builds**:
   ```dockerfile
   # Build stage
   FROM golang:1.21 AS builder
   WORKDIR /app
   COPY go.mod go.sum ./
   RUN go mod download
   COPY . .
   RUN CGO_ENABLED=0 GOOS=linux go build -a -installsuffix cgo -ldflags="-w -s" -o service ./cmd/server

   # Final stage
   FROM alpine:3.18
   RUN apk --no-cache add ca-certificates
   COPY --from=builder /app/service /service
   CMD ["/service"]
   ```
   This reduces the final image size dramatically by excluding the Go compiler and build tools.

2. **Optimize Go Binary Size**:
   - Use `CGO_ENABLED=0` to create a statically linked binary
   - Use `-ldflags="-w -s"` to strip debugging information
   - Consider using tools like UPX for additional compression

3. **Use Minimal Base Images**:
   - Alpine Linux (2-5MB) instead of Debian/Ubuntu (100MB+)
   - Distroless images for even smaller and more secure images
   - Scratch image for the absolute minimum (works well with Go's static binaries)
   ```dockerfile
   FROM scratch
   COPY --from=builder /app/service /service
   CMD ["/service"]
   ```

4. **Include Only Necessary Files**:
   - Copy only the compiled binary and required configuration
   - Use `.dockerignore` to exclude tests, documentation, and other unnecessary files

5. **Layer Optimization**:
   - Order instructions from least to most frequently changing
   - Combine related RUN commands to reduce layer count

6. **Dependency Management**:
   - Use Go modules with a `go.sum` file for deterministic builds
   - Copy and download dependencies before copying source code to leverage caching

7. **Security Optimizations**:
   - Run as a non-root user
   - Use a read-only filesystem where possible
   - Remove any debugging tools or unnecessary packages

8. **Build-Time Optimizations**:
   - Use BuildKit for faster, more efficient builds
   - Consider using Go's build cache in CI/CD pipelines

By implementing these optimizations, you can reduce a Go microservice image from 1GB+ (using a standard Go image) to under 20MB or even under 10MB with scratch, while improving security and performance.

### 4. What strategies would you use to manage configuration in containerized microservices?

**Answer:**
Managing configuration in containerized microservices requires balancing flexibility, security, and operational simplicity. Here are effective strategies:

1. **Environment Variables**:
   - Follow the 12-Factor App methodology
   - Pass configuration through environment variables in Docker Compose or Kubernetes
   ```yaml
   # docker-compose.yml
   services:
     users-service:
       environment:
         - DB_HOST=postgres
         - LOG_LEVEL=info
         - FEATURE_FLAGS=authentication,rate-limiting
   ```
   - Use environment variables for values that change between environments

2. **Configuration Files**:
   - Mount configuration files as volumes
   - Use for complex configurations that are difficult to express as environment variables
   ```yaml
   volumes:
     - ./config/users-service.yaml:/app/config.yaml
   ```
   - Consider using templating to generate config files at startup

3. **Configuration Services**:
   - Use tools like etcd, Consul, or Spring Cloud Config
   - Enables dynamic configuration updates without redeploying
   - Provides centralized configuration management
   ```go
   // Example using Consul
   client, _ := api.NewClient(api.DefaultConfig())
   kv := client.KV()
   pair, _, _ := kv.Get("services/users-service/db-connection", nil)
   dbConnection := string(pair.Value)
   ```

4. **Secrets Management**:
   - Never store secrets in images or source code
   - Use Docker secrets, Kubernetes secrets, or HashiCorp Vault
   - Encrypt sensitive configuration at rest
   ```yaml
   # docker-compose.yml with secrets
   services:
     users-service:
       secrets:
         - db_password
         - api_key

   secrets:
     db_password:
       file: ./secrets/db_password.txt
     api_key:
       file: ./secrets/api_key.txt
   ```

5. **Feature Flags**:
   - Use configuration to enable/disable features
   - Implement feature flags for gradual rollouts
   - Store feature flags in a service like LaunchDarkly or a database

6. **Configuration Validation**:
   - Validate configuration at startup
   - Fail fast if required configuration is missing or invalid
   ```go
   func validateConfig(cfg *Config) error {
       if cfg.DatabaseURL == "" {
           return errors.New("database URL is required")
       }
       // More validation...
       return nil
   }
   ```

7. **Configuration Hierarchy**:
   - Implement a hierarchy: defaults → files → environment variables → command-line flags
   - This provides flexibility while maintaining sensible defaults
   - Libraries like Viper make this easy in Go
   ```go
   viper.SetDefault("port", 8080)
   viper.SetConfigFile("./config.yaml")
   viper.ReadInConfig()
   viper.AutomaticEnv()
   ```

8. **Configuration Documentation**:
   - Document all configuration options
   - Include default values, validation rules, and examples
   - Provide sample configurations for different environments

By combining these strategies, you can create a flexible, secure, and maintainable configuration system for your containerized microservices.

### 5. How would you handle database migrations in a containerized microservice environment?

**Answer:**
Handling database migrations in a containerized microservice environment requires careful planning to ensure reliability and consistency. Here are effective approaches:

1. **Dedicated Migration Service/Job**:
   - Create a separate container specifically for running migrations
   - Run as an init container or job before starting the microservice
   ```yaml
   # In Kubernetes
   apiVersion: batch/v1
   kind: Job
   metadata:
     name: users-db-migration
   spec:
     template:
       spec:
         containers:
         - name: migration
           image: users-service-migrations:latest
           command: ["./migrate", "up"]
           env:
             - name: DB_URL
               valueFrom:
                 secretKeyRef:
                   name: db-credentials
                   key: url
         restartPolicy: Never
   ```

2. **Migration Tools**:
   - Use established migration tools like:
     - Golang Migrate
     - Flyway
     - Liquibase
     - SQLx Migrations
   - These provide versioning, rollback capabilities, and transaction support
   ```go
   // Example using golang-migrate
   m, err := migrate.New(
       "file://migrations",
       "postgres://postgres:password@postgres:5432/users?sslmode=disable")
   if err != nil {
       log.Fatal(err)
   }
   if err := m.Up(); err != nil && err != migrate.ErrNoChange {
       log.Fatal(err)
   }
   ```

3. **Versioned Migrations**:
   - Number or timestamp migrations sequentially
   - Store migrations in version control alongside application code
   - Example file structure:
     ```
     migrations/
     ├── 000001_create_users_table.up.sql
     ├── 000001_create_users_table.down.sql
     ├── 000002_add_email_verification.up.sql
     └── 000002_add_email_verification.down.sql
     ```

4. **Idempotent Migrations**:
   - Design migrations to be safely rerunnable
   - Use SQL constructs like `IF NOT EXISTS` or `CREATE OR REPLACE`
   ```sql
   -- Example of an idempotent migration
   CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users (
       id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
       email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
       created_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL
   );

   -- Add column if it doesn't exist
   DO $$
   BEGIN
       IF NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM information_schema.columns
                     WHERE table_name='users' AND column_name='verified') THEN
           ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN verified BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE;
       END IF;
   END $$;

5. **Coordination with Application Deployment**:
   - Run migrations before deploying new application versions
   - Ensure backward compatibility during rolling updates
   - Consider using a migration lock to prevent concurrent migrations

6. **Testing Migrations**:
   - Test migrations in CI/CD pipeline
   - Use temporary databases for testing
   - Verify both up and down migrations

7. **Handling Failures**:
   - Implement proper error handling and logging
   - Use transactions where appropriate
   - Have a rollback strategy for failed migrations

8. **Multi-Service Considerations**:
   - For microservices with separate databases:
     - Each service manages its own migrations
     - Coordinate dependent migrations between services
   - For shared databases:
     - Clearly define schema ownership
     - Use schema prefixes to avoid conflicts

9. **Zero-Downtime Migrations**:
   - For large tables, consider techniques like:
     - Creating new tables and gradually migrating data
     - Using database views to abstract schema changes
     - Implementing dual writes during transition periods

By implementing these strategies, you can ensure reliable and consistent database schema management across your containerized microservice environment.
