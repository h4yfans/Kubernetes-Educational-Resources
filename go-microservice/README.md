## Interview Focus Areas

Based on industry trends, interviewers typically focus on these key areas when evaluating candidates for Golang microservices positions:

1. **Golang Proficiency**: Concurrency patterns, error handling, memory management
2. **Microservice Design**: Service boundaries, communication, data consistency
3. **Kubernetes Knowledge**: Deployment strategies, resource management, service discovery
4. **AWS Integration**: Using managed services, security, cost optimization
5. **Observability**: Monitoring, logging, tracing, and debugging distributed systems
6. **System Design**: Scaling, resilience, performance considerations
7. **Security**: Authentication, authorization, data protection

The resources in this directory will help you prepare for all these areas and more.
